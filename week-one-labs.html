            <h1>Week 1 Lab: Website Creation and Unity</h1>
            <h2>Website Creation</h2>
            <p>As part of our the "HCI for Mixed Reality" course, we have to set up a blog. This is that blog. The style of this website is inspired by Wikipedia's Vector layout. I find it's a wonderful, simple, and to-the-point layout that doesn't bloat the user with (too much) javascript and ads. Additionally, this style is the same style I used for my projects back in first year of university. I remember spending quite a while trying to get the top tabs to be correctly positioned.</p>
            <p>To make this website appear on the internet, I followed the <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> tutorial and set up the website. It was surprisingly easy compared to the hoops we had to jump through back in first year.</p>

            <h2>Unity</h2>
            <p>I've never used Unity before, I've only dabbled with Godot, but it wasn't too hard to get Unity set up. It turns out that big companies like it when users don't complain about the installation process by making it as streamlined as possible. Though I dislike the trend towards having a congregated hub instead of simply booting up the program to a 'load file' screen, it does make it more convenient to install the necessary modules for this course. Once that was done, I just had to create a new Unity file, and presto, I've got the foundations to learn Unity.</p>
