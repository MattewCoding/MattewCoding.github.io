            <h1>Week 1 Lecture: VR Dizziness and CAVE</h1>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Virtual reality can immerse users to the point where they perceive their virtual environment as real,
                potentially leading to accidents when they forget their actual surroundings. Various solutions have been
                proposed to mitigate these risks, including auditory warnings, proximity detectors, and removing
                obstacles in the real world beforehand. However, care must be taken to distinguish these
                immersion-breaking measures from virtual reality's goal of providing a fully immersive experience.</p>
            <p>The CAVE system, unlike head-mounted displays, projects visuals onto the walls of a room, allowing
                multiple people to view the environment simultaneously. Although it offers a higher level of immersion
                compared to head-mounted displays, the CAVE System is significantly more expensive and requires a
                dedicated space for projection.</p>

            <h2>Safeguards Against Ourselves</h2>
            <p>There is no shortage of videos and stories of VR users forgetting that what they are seeing and
                experiencing is not, in fact, real. This is because VR attempts to fool the senses into believing its
                simulated reality, and because most of the brain is devoted to sight, tricking those parts of the brain
                is usually enough to make us buy into the simulated reality.</p>
            <p>This can cause problems when there are real-world obstacles, such as tables, walls, or wires, that are
                not replicated in simulated reality. Since the user believes that there is no obstacle, they will run
                into these obstacles and potentially break them. For example, if a user is playing a VR boxing game,
                they will simulate punches and kicks by physically doing so. However, they may accidentally punch or
                kick real-world objects, such as a TV or a table. Not only would this injure the user, but it may also
                break the objects. To fix this, there are different types of solutions that can be implemented. On the
                development side, we can program into the VR game a warning system to alert the user that they may crash
                into some real-world object. This may involve installing proximity detectors to measure the distance
                between hands and legs to nearby objects. The user can also avoid these situations by removing nearby
                obstacles, ensuring that they can freely move around without harm.</p>

            </figure>

            <p>There's also the issue of dizziness. For the same reasons people get carsick-- namely, the incongruence
                of seeing motion but not feeling motion-- people get VR dizziness. There is also the fact that while VR
                attempts to simulate reality, it is not perfect, which can cause the brain to get confused. Examples
                include a VR headset's FoV being variable and different from a human FoV or a VR headset experiencing
                latency, causing a mismatch in what should be happening (a shift in perspective) and what is happening
                (nothing, because the VR headset hasn't updated). This causes the user to be disoriented and possibly
                lose balance and fall, leading to injury. To fix this, we can remove some visual effects, like motion
                blur, or discretize movement; instead of smoothly walking from one place to another, a user can teleport
                from one location to another. Thus, the user never moves continuously, going from being stationary in
                one place to being stationary at another place. The user can also take breaks, get comfortable, and stay
                hydrated to reduce dizziness.</p>

                <figcaption>Left side: A user loses balance and falls due to dizziness. Right side: The reason why they
                    are dizzy, that is, because of racing</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>These solutions fall into two categories: either make the simulated reality less realistic or let the
                user self-regulate. The first category is antithetical to the goal of simulated reality, and the second
                should never be relied upon, yet these stopgap solutions are compromises that both the developer and the
                user accept in order to be able to have fun with VR.</p>

            <h2>The CAVE System and HMDs</h2>
            <p>The CAVE system is a room in which a simulated reality is projected, differing from HMDs in that the
                simulated reality is not projected onto a helmet or goggles. The user will usually be wearing glasses in
                the CAVE to enhance the viewing experience. Some advantages are that it allows for a large-scale
                immersion, allowing for a lower latency in updating the environment when the user wants to look around.
                It is also less intrusive, in that the user can freely move around in the room, instead of being stuck
                to an HMD. However, the CAVE requires there to be a room for it to be effective, and there is a large
                upfront cost in implementing one such system; it is more than an order of magnitude above buying a
                normal headset.</p>
            <p>Within the Reality-Virtuality Continuum of Milgram, it is very much in the Monolithic Computing and
                Virtual Environment quadrant; more than one person can be in the room to experience the simulation, and
                the environment is entirely projected onto the walls of the room.</p>
