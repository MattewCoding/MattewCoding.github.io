            <h1>Week 2: Unity Basics</h1>
            <h2>First Week of Development: Getting Used to Unity</h2>
            <p>This is my first time doing any kind of work with Unity. To learn the basics, I followed the classic <a href="https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball?uv=60">Roll-a-Ball</a> tutorial. The first step was to actually create the project. I created a new Universal 3D Project and got to creating the basics. The second step was to create the objects and the material for the scene. We need a aqua sphere to interact with and a gray plane for it to move about on, so we had to create that.</p>
